# EmailSpamExtension

## Project Details:
This is a Google Chrome extension that allows the user to select certain emails in their Gmail inbox and have them be remembered and highlighted as priority emails.

Since this is a Chrome extension, it can be personalized based on the data the user wants highlighted and the AI learns through patterns and tokenization to be able to accurately select all similar emails.

## Tech Stack:
- Heroku Python Server
- Python Flask
- HTML/CSS
- Javascript (AJAX, JQuery)
- MongoDB

## Current Limitations:
Since it's personalized, currently, the extension only has room to connect to one database. This means that multiple users cannot use it without overwriting other users' data or adding to it.

## Future Implementations:
Make it so that multiple people can use the extension simultaneously!
